Welcome to your new dbt project!

### This is a simple sandbox for learning dbt tools and some other cool stuff, I will use
this README file to explain some configuration changes step by step.

The first task on dbt will be to change dbt_project.yml to change the working directoty
from root (default) to superstore_dw, after that perform a dbt test and dbt run to Check 
if everything is fine.

On v1.0.1 the changes are:
- To name the project as superstore_dw
- To change root to -\superstore_dw
- To test if everything is fine

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test
